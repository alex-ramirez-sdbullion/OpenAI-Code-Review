## Prerequisites

- [Azure DevOps Account](https://dev.azure.com/)
- An AI provider credential:

  - [Azure OpenAI resource with API key](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource)

## Getting started

1. Install the Open AI Code Review DevOps Extension from the [Azure DevOps Marketplace]([https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AidanCole.oaicr)).
1. Add Open AI Code Review Task to Your Pipeline. Use the following example configuration:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    exclude:
      - '*'

pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - '*'

jobs:
- job: CodeReview
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
  - task: OpenAICodeReviewTask@1
    inputs:
      aiProvider: 'openai'
      api_key: $(OpenAI_ApiKey)
      ai_model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
      bugs: true
      performance: true
      best_practices: true
      file_extensions: 'js,ts,css,html'
      file_excludes: 'file1.js,file2.py,secret.txt'
      additional_prompts: 'Fix variable naming, Ensure consistent indentation, Review error handling approach'
```

> ðŸ’¡ Store API keys in secure pipeline variables or Azure Key Vault secrets and reference them here instead of hardcoding values.

1. (Optional) Configure Azure OpenAI instead of the public OpenAI service:

```yaml
- task: OpenAICodeReviewTask@1
  inputs:
    aiProvider: 'azure-openai'
    api_key: $(AzureOpenAI_ApiKey)
    azureEndpoint: 'https://my-resource.openai.azure.com'
    azureDeployment: 'gpt-4o'
    azureApiVersion: '2024-02-15-preview'
    bugs: true
    performance: true
    best_practices: true
```

Ensure the deployment name matches what you configured in Azure OpenAI Studio and that the API version is supported for that deployment.
